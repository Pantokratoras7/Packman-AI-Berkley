# Packman-AI-Berkley
First 2 Pacman Projects from Berkley's AI course, considering DFS, BFS, Uniform Cost and A*, minimax, alpha-beta pruning and expectimax algorithms, while also designing heuristics and evaluation functions.

Moreover, a Kakuro (japanese game) implementation is added on this repository (nothing to do with packman), as it was also implemented on my AI course, where CSP algorithms are used, such as BackTracking with MRV, ForwardChecking and MAC.
